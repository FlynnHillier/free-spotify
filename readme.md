# Description
This project utilises undetected chromedriver to automatically claim usable free spotify premium accounts.

## Questions
#### How does it work?
This works by utilsing the 3 month free spotify premium that spotify periodically offers to new users. By generating new accounts, this promotion is capable of being claimed. Then by using the official spotify developer API, playlists from previous accounts can be copied onto the newly generated accounts, making them instantly usable.

#### why are my card details required?
A valid set of card details are required to sign up to spotify premium, even their free premium-promotions. While this is the case, *your card is* __*not*__ *charged*. Feel free to look through the code, it is more than reasonable to be cautious entering such details into foreign code.

#### how many cards do i need?
Spotify only allows for users to claim a promotion *once per set of card details*. This means if you wish to create multiple accounts, a proportionate amount of extra card details are required. I recommend utiling the virtual-bank 'revolut' which offers up to 20 virtual cards which can be created/deleted free of charge and very-often. By creating a card, then deleting it after use - an unlimited amount of card details is accessible. (Note, if using revolut, the 'disposable' virtual card will not be accepted by spotify)

It is worth mentioning a few steps require manual interaction. Most notably, it is likely spotify will request additional confirmation on your card, which you must confirm on whatever device you bank on.
